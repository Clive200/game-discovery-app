### Deployed link

### What I built

- A React + TypeScript + Vite app with a responsive layout.
- Game browsing UI with cards, loading skeletons, and error handling.
- Filters and UI controls (genre list, platform selector, sort selector, and search input).
- Data fetching hooks to load games/genres/platforms from the RAWG API.

### What I learned

This project helped me learn **React**, especially component composition, hooks, props/state, and working with APIs.

### Acknowledgements

Much of the code and overall structure comes from **Mosh Hamedani’s tutorial** (Programming with Mosh). I used the tutorial as the primary guide and adapted it while fixing issues and wiring up deployment.
